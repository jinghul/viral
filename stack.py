class Stacker(object):
    """
    A transformer applying fitting a predictor `pred` to data in a way
        that will allow a higher-up predictor to build a model utilizing both this 
        and other predictors correctly.

    The fit_transform(self, x, y) of this class will create a column matrix, whose 
        each row contains the prediction of `pred` fitted on other rows than this one. 
        This allows a higher-level predictor to correctly fit a model on this, and other
        column matrices obtained from other lower-level predictors.

    The fit(self, x, y) and transform(self, x_) methods, will fit `pred` on all 
        of `x`, and transform the output of `x_` (which is either `x` or not) using the fitted 
        `pred`.

    Arguments:    
        pred: A lower-level predictor to stack.

        cv_fn: Function taking `x`, and returning a cross-validation object. In `fit_transform`
            th train and test indices of the object will be iterated over. For each iteration, `pred` will
            be fitted to the `x` and `y` with rows corresponding to the
            train indices, and the test indices of the output will be obtained
            by predicting on the corresponding indices of `x`.
